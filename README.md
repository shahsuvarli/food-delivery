Food Delivery Web Application
=============================

Welcome to my food delivery web application! Built using ReactJS with Next.js, Redux-Toolkit, MUI, and React-i18next, this web application is designed to provide users with a seamless and user-friendly experience while ordering food.

With this application, you can browse through a variety of food items and place an order with ease. The ordering process is customizable, allowing you to modify your order to your liking. Once your order is placed, you can check your invoice to ensure that everything is correct.

The application is built using Next.js, which allows for server-side rendering, making it fast and responsive. It also incorporates Redux-Toolkit, a state management library, to manage complex state and ensure smooth communication between components.

Additionally, Material UI (MUI) is used for styling and React-i18next for internationalization, making the application accessible to users all around the world.
